Word Count Extension
=================

A stupid simple word count extension. I write a lot of articles in Markdown and
needed a simple way to count words. Note that this extension is just splitting
on whitespace which means it will count embedded code a bit high. I *could* strip
out code in Markdown (everything tabbed over once), but code counts in article 
length as well.
